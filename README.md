### Tuts+ Course: How to Build a Hypermedia-Driven REST API
#### Instructor: Jason Rhodes

In this course we'll walk through building a simple REST API with Node.js and Express. By focusing on nouns, verbs, and relationships, you'll complete this course with a clear understanding of what hypermedia is all about and how emerging hypermedia-driven API standards can make all of our lives as developers a little easier.

This example will walk through building a very basic movie API to demonstrate how to take an RPC-style ("RMM Level 0" or "Swamp of POX") API and improve incrementally, explaining concepts of resources, HTTP verbs, and hypermedia along the way.

Note: If you are starting with this tutorial, make sure you do the following after you clone the repo.

```bash
$ git fetch
$ git checkout origin/1-rpc
$ git checkout -b 1-rpc
```

This will get you onto the 1-rpc branch. As you follow along through the course, you can do the same commands to download the other branches that will allow you to keep pace with the tutorial as it builds.
